# visual-bloch
visualization of a qubit on bloch sphere, also provide tools to numerically solve bloch equations.

## Requirements
* python 3+
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib

## Provides
1. Set up an experiment scheme by providing a sequence of sections with costimized physical quantities and duration.
2. Numerically solve bloch equation for a given experiment scheme.
3. Animate the time evolution of the solution or simply plot its trajectory on bloch sphere.

## Usage
See `example.py` in the folder.
